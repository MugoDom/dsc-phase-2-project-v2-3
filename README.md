## Project Overview



### Business and Data Understanding
Real estate is a physical asset with the potential to appreciate in value over time. In fact, historical data shows that real estate appreciates at a higher rate than the rate of inflation. This means that over time, the value of your property will increase, which can lead to significant profits.As we can see the industry is a very lucrative but also has the ability to cause great losses when house pricing gets out of control. This means that potential investors have to make smart and informed decisions so as to safe guard their money, they want to get maximum value, no matter how much is spent.

To help our stakeholders KC Real Estate Agency seeks to use a data-driven insight

How do we go about ensuring that this real estate agency gets the most out of its money? We've setup the following objectives to help guide:

**1. To determine which variables affect house pricing, more specifically those that increase the value of a house.**

**2. Factors that affect grade of a house. We want to invest in only high grade houses despite the price.**

**3. To identify similar areas of spatial clustering based on the price.**
